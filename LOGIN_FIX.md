# ✅ Login Issue Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong:

The app was trying to connect to `http://10.0.2.2:3000` which only works for the **emulator**.

Your **physical device** needs your computer's actual IP address.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed:

Changed API URL from:
```
http://10.0.2.2:3000/api  ❌ (Emulator only)
```

To:
```
http://192.168.4.88:3000/api  ✅ (Your computer's IP)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### **If Login Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check WiFi Connection:**
   - Both phone and computer on SAME WiFi
   - Not using mobile data on phone

2. **Check Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure server is running
   cd C:\Projects\FoodLink
   node server.js
   ```
   Should show: `✅ Server running on port 3000`

3. **Check Firewall:**
   - Windows Firewall might be blocking port 3000
   - Allow Node.js through firewall

4. **Test Connection:**
   - On your phone's browser, go to: `http://192.168.4.88:3000`
   - You should see a response (not error)
