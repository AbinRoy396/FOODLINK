## ⚠️ Recommendations

### **High Priority:**

1. **Add Database Indexes** ⚠️
   - Currently no custom indexes
   - Would improve query performance
   - Recommended for production

2. **Add Input Sanitization**
   - Prevent SQL injection
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries (already doing this ✅)

3. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent brute force attacks
   - Limit login attempts
   - Protect API endpoints

### **Medium Priority:**

4. **Add Logging**
   - Winston for file logging
   - Track all API requests
   - Monitor errors

5. **Add Pagination**
   - For large datasets
   - Improve performance
   - Better user experience

6. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Move JWT_SECRET to .env
   - Configure for production
   - Secure sensitive data

### **Low Priority:**

7. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Jest + Supertest
   - Automated testing
   - CI/CD integration

8. **Add API Documentation**
   - Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Interactive docs
   - Better developer experience
